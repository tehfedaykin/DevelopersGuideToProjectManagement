						<p>Waterfall project management is a sequential, linear process of project management.

							complete, and each phase’s completion is terminal—waterfall management does not 
							allow you to return to a previous phase.</p>

						<div class="card">
							<p class="fragment text-left">1. <b>The Planning Game</b> addresses two key questions in software development: <br />
								- predicting what will be accomplished by the due date<br />
								- determining what to do next.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<p class="fragment text-left">2. <b>Small Releases</b> means the team releases running, tested software, delivering business 
								value chosen by the Customer, every iteration. The most important aspect is that the 
								software is visible, and given to the customer, at the end of every iteration.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<p class="fragment text-left">3. <b>Metaphor</b> is a simple evocative description of how the program works, like “this program 
								works like a hive of bees, going out for pollen & bringing it back to the hive” as a description 
								for an agent-based information retrieval system.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<p class="fragment text-left">4. <b>Simple Design</b> means building the simple solution first, and not abstracting before needed. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<p class="fragment text-left">5. <b>Testing builds</b> tests against acceptance criteria and uses them to prove to themselves, and 
								to the customer, that the feature is implemented correctly.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<p class="fragment text-left">6. <b>Refactoring</b> Design improvement and removal of duplication (a sure sign of poor design), and on 
								increasing the “cohesion” of the code, while lowering the “coupling”</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<p class="fragment text-left">7. <b>Pair Programming</b> All production software in XP is built by two programmers, sitting side by side, 
								at the same machine.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<p class="fragment text-left">8. <b>Collective Ownership</b> any pair of programmers can improve any code at any time, no one person is responsible 
								for knowing how one area of the codebase works. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<p class="fragment text-left">9. <b>Continuous Integration</b> multiple builds per day keep the system fully integrated at all times.</p>

							<p class="fragment text-left">10. <b>40-hour week work</b> life balance makes better software</p>

						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<p class="fragment text-left">12. <b>Coding Standard</b> Code must be formatted to agreed coding standards. Coding standards keep the code consistent

								enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. It is, 
								essentially, the team’s “To Do” list. The product backlog is constantly revisited, 
								re-prioritized and maintained by the Product Owner because, as we learn more or 
								as the market changes, items may no longer be relevant or problems may get solved in other ways.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<p><b>Sprint Backlog</b> is the list of items, user stories, or bug fixes, selected by the development 
								team for implementation in the current sprint cycle. Before each sprint, in the sprint planning meeting 
								the team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog. A sprint backlog 
								may be flexible and can evolve during a sprint.</p>

								<b>Increment (or Sprint Goal)</b> is the usable end-product from a sprint. You may not hear the word “increment” 
								out in the world, as it’s often referred to as the team’s definition of “Done”, a milestone, the sprint goal, or 
								even a full version or a shipped epic. It just depends on how your teams defines “Done” and how you define your sprint goals.

							<p><b>Sprint Planning</b> is the meeting for the entire team to be understand the sprint goal, and commit to the

							<p><b>Daily SCRUM/standup</b> The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and

								by the team and can help the team optimize their transparency and delivery flow.</i></b> As the
